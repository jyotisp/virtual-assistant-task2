In this task I have created a virtual assistant that will open all the apps and will also perform a google search,play music,open any file,opens youtube,sends whatsapp message to the person we 
we specify, and alos it runs all basuc Linux commands and all these activities are possible only through our voice control. No need to physically open the application or type any command

It basically runs Linux commands like date,cal,ifconfig,ls,tells about current dir(pwd),tells the memory,hard disk space ,etc
