# virtual-assistant-task2

In this task I have created a virtual assistant that will open all the apps and will also perform a google search,play music,open any file,opens youtube,sends whatsapp message to the person we specify, and also it runs all basic Linux commands and all these activities are controlled only through our voice. No need to physically open the application or type any command

It basically runs Linux commands like date,cal,ifconfig,ls,tells about current dir(pwd),tells the memory,hard disk space ,etc


This task is given by Vimal Daga Sir and I have tried to do it well.
